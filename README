Whole package of workarounds so I can comfortably use OperaMobile on my Plasma
Active tablet. The stuff here will enable one to

- Create a nepomuk bookmark with the current page
- Open the current page in firefox
- Open the current page in smplayer (for youtube)

via UI buttons on the opera-mobile chrome.

The problem with Opera extensions is they don't actually let you run
external programs/commands - you have only just about as much power/
permission as a web-app. The workaround that limitation here is as
thus: we make Opera extensions that send out specific requests via
Ajax calls to localhost, and we run a simple local python server that
recognizes the requests and runs the appropriate program.

'webserver.py' is the local python webserver that should be started
first. 'nepomukbookmark', 'oifirefox' and 'youtube' are each individual
Opera extensions that add their respective buttons to the chrome.
